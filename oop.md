# JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming
    -JS is not an class-based language !!!
    -JS is prototype based language

## OOP:-
    -Object Oriented Programming (style or paradigm)

## Object:
    -collection of properties and functions
    -i.e : toLowerCase

## Why use OOP?
    -to avoid mess in code (spaghetti code) and produce more cleaner code

## Parts of OOP:
    -Object Literal  (an object)

        -constructor function
        -prototypes
        -classes
        -instances [ new , this ]

## 4 Pillars / Types :     
    -Encapsulation
        => Encapsulation is the wraping of data (variables) and methods within one unit.
    
    -Abstraction
        => Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.
    
    -Inheritance
        => Inheritance lets one class acquire properties and methods of another.

    -Polymorphism
        => Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same parent class.

## new keyword :
    -step 1 : empty object (instance) is created
    -step 2 : construcyor function is called by new
    -step 3 : arguments are injected in constructor /
         The constructor function is called with this set to the new object
    -step 4 : get in function [ that object is returned.]
